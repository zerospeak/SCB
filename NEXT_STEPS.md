# Next Steps for HealthGuard Solutions

## 1. Real Risk Scoring (ML Integration)
- Replace the demo risk logic with a real machine learning model or advanced business rules for claim risk scoring.
- Optionally, expose model explainability (why a claim is risky) for compliance and user trust.

## 2. Automated Testing
- Expand e2e tests to cover all major user flows (login, claim CRUD, analytics, error handling).
- Add integration tests for API endpoints.
- Set up CI to run tests on every commit.

## 3. Health Checks & Monitoring
- Add health check endpoints for all services (API, frontend, ETL, DB).
- Integrate with monitoring tools (Prometheus, Grafana, etc.) for uptime and error tracking.

## 4. Security Hardening
- Enforce HTTPS in production.
- Use secure secrets management (not hardcoded keys).
- Add rate limiting and input validation to prevent abuse.
- Implement audit logging for sensitive actions.

## 5. User & Audit Trail
- Add user management (CRUD for users, roles).
- Implement audit trails for claim changes and logins for compliance.

## 6. Production-Ready Deployment
- Add environment-specific configuration (dev, staging, prod).
- Harden Docker images (non-root user, minimal base images).
- Add Kubernetes manifests for all services (not just agentic service).

## 7. Analytics & Reporting
- Enhance frontend dashboards with more analytics, filtering, and export options.
- Add reporting endpoints for business users.

## 8. Documentation
- Document all API endpoints and data flows.
- Add architecture diagrams and deployment guides for new team members.

## 9. Performance & Scalability
- Load test the system (you have a load-test.js, but expand coverage).
- Optimize DB queries and API performance for large datasets.

## 10. Accessibility & UX
- Ensure all frontends meet accessibility standards (WCAG).
- Add user feedback for errors and long-running operations.
