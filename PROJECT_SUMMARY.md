# Project Summary, Lessons Learned, and Developer Tips

## Step-by-Step Summary of Actions Taken

1. **Initial Diagnosis:**
   - Project was scaffolded but not fully wired up for containerized development.
   - Only instructions.md and a basic README.md were present.

2. **Project Structure and Scaffolding:**
   - Created/updated README.md to reflect the intended structure and services.
   - Verified presence of API, frontend, ETL, and database directories and files.

3. **Backend (API) Improvements:**
   - Ensured Swagger UI is always enabled for dev/demo.
   - Added CORS policy to allow frontend (port 5002) to call the API.
   - Set ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Development in the API Dockerfile for dev features.
   - Fixed Dockerfile to ensure the API listens on port 80 (matching Docker Compose mapping).

4. **Frontend (Blazor WebAssembly) Improvements:**
   - Switched Dockerfile to use nginx to serve static files.
   - Ensured the Dockerfile copies the entire published output, not just wwwroot.
   - Added placeholder app.css and favicon.ico to prevent 404 errors.
   - Fixed package references in Frontend.csproj to match .NET 8 (was .NET 6).

5. **ETL Service:**
   - Ensured the ETL container stays alive for dev/demo by adding a wait loop.

6. **SQL Server (Azure SQL Edge):**
   - Added a persistent Docker volume (sql_data) to prevent re-initialization on every restart.
   - Updated run-dev.ps1 to avoid using `-v` with `docker compose down` (which deletes volumes).

7. **Dev Script (run-dev.ps1):**
   - Added clean, restore, and build steps for the .NET solution before starting containers.
   - Added verbose logging and container status output.
   - Tails logs for all services for real-time feedback.

8. **Documentation:**
   - Updated all major Markdown files (README.md, FRONTEND.md, BACKEND.md, DATABASE.md, ETL.md, DEPLOYMENT.md) with current state, troubleshooting, and run instructions.

9. **Rebuilds and Testing:**
   - Rebuilt all containers multiple times to ensure all fixes were applied.
   - Diagnosed and fixed issues with port mappings, environment variables, and static file serving.

## Lessons Learned
- **Always match package versions to the target framework.** Mismatched Blazor/WebAssembly package versions caused missing files and runtime errors.
- **Explicitly set ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT in Docker for dev features.** Otherwise, the app defaults to Production and disables Swagger and other dev tools.
- **Use persistent volumes for databases.** Avoid using `-v` with `docker compose down` unless you want to reset all data.
- **Copy the entire publish output for Blazor WebAssembly.** Only copying wwwroot will break the app; you need all framework files.
- **Check logs and browser console for root causes.** Most frontend "Loading" issues are due to missing files or CORS/network errors.
- **Automate everything in scripts.** Clean, restore, build, and container orchestration should be one command for reliability.

## Tips and Tricks for Future Developers
- **Rebuild containers after any Dockerfile or environment variable change.** Old containers may cache incorrect settings.
- **Check port mappings in Docker Compose.** Ensure host and container ports match the app's listening port.
- **Use run-dev.ps1 for a clean, repeatable dev environment.**
- **Keep documentation up to date with the actual system state.**
- **For Blazor WebAssembly:**
  - Use nginx or a static file server in production.
  - Ensure all static assets and framework files are present in the publish output.
- **For SQL Server:**
  - Use a named volume for persistence.
  - Only reset the volume if you want to wipe all data.
- **For API:**
  - Always enable Swagger in dev.
  - Use CORS policies to allow frontend access.

## Enhancements and Recommendations
- **Add health checks for all services.**
- **Add automated integration and e2e tests.**
- **Add CI/CD pipeline for automated builds and deployments.**
- **Add authentication and production-grade security.**
- **Add real ML model integration for claim scoring.**
- **Add persistent claim storage in the backend.**
- **Add more analytics and charting to the frontend.**
- **Add user and audit trail tables to the database.**
- **Add environment-specific configuration for dev, staging, and prod.**
- **Document all endpoints and data flows.**

## Final State
- All containers start and run in dev mode with correct port mappings and persistent storage.
- Swagger UI is available for API testing.
- The frontend loads and communicates with the API.
- SQL Server data is persistent.
- All documentation is up to date.
- The dev script automates the entire workflow.
